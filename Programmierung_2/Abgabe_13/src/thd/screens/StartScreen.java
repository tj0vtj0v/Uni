                Step into the combat boots of a fearless commando, dropped behind enemy lines with one mission: to infiltrate, outmaneuver,
                and outgun the enemy forces.

                As the main character, you're not just any soldier â€“ you are the elite, the brave, the unstoppable.

                Prepare to face relentless waves of enemies, dodge a hailstorm of bullets, and overcome deadly obstacles.
                With only your trusty machine gun and a finite supply of grenades, every step you take is a pulse-pounding fight for survival.

                Master the Controls and Dominate the Battlefield:

                      W   - Propel yourself forward into the heart of danger.
                      A   - Strafe left, evading enemy fire and finding the perfect cover.
                      S   - Retreat strategically, regroup, and plan your next move.
                      D   - Strafe right, outmaneuvering your foes with swift precision.
                    Space - Unleash a storm of bullets, mowing down enemies in your path.

                So, soldier, gear up and get ready to prove that you have what it takes... and remember: ONLY WHO DARES WINS!
