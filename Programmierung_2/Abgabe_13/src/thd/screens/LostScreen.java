                Brave Commando,

                The mission has ended in catastrophic failure.
                The enemy forces have crushed your defenses,
                and the land you swore to protect is now under their control.

                Your Score: --> %d <--                     is discarded...

                WHO DARES WINNS â€“ BUT TODAY, DEFEAT HAS STRUCK!

                Thank you for playing, soldier. Reflect on this defeat,
                harness your anger, and prepare for the next fight.
